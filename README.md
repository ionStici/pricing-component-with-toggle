## About the Project

The _"Pricing Component with Toggle"_ is a Frontend Mentor challenge that showcases a pricing page with the ability to switch between monthly and yearly billing options.

This project was uniquely constructed by building the DOM and its functionality solely with **JavaScript**, keeping the `index.html` file empty. **Scss** was used for styling to ensure a polished look, **Vite** handled the bundling for efficient development, and **ReduxJS** managed the state for the toggle functionality.
